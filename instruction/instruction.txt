Please create a new Next.JS Project.

Create Users Page: 
Create a new page routed to '/users' and display the users listed in Users.json as cards with the following information displayed: 
* name
* company name
* email

Create User Feature: 
Add a "Create User" button to the /users page.
When this button is clicked, it should display a Modal with a Create User form. 
When the form is submitted - a new item should be added to the Users.json - all fields should be populated, please refer to the JSON for all properties.
The goal is for the new user to be displayed on the list of users on the /users page.
